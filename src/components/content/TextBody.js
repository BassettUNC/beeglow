            <p className="textContents">The journey began with no destination, just an inspired curiosity feeding a desire for exploration. What does it mean to live a creative life? Boundless questions pushing preconceived boundaries, physically, emotionally, artistically. Family, the studio/gallery, the property, life moving in an asymmetrical dance, stretching our limits before easing back to center.</p>
            <p className="textContents">The realization that life is moments, experiences in the now, that cultivate and enrich the path towards understanding. Picking flowers, welcoming friends to the gallery, hands in the wax, kids in the mud, smiles and tears, the real that life is. A moment in understanding is now illuminating that we have reached our destination on this adventure.</p>
            <p className="textContents">Our gratitude is immense as we step away from the studio, giving thanks to all who have shared in our journey to make it the amazing exploration it has been. A special thank you to the honeybees, for weaving their beautiful perfection into our life and inspiring the dream. Onward and upward, embracing the opportunity to experience new adventures on lifeâ€™s journey.</p>
            <p className="textContents">Much Love.</p>
